We research and develop novel physics-based AI accelerators using inherently stochastic electronics.

Modern advances in artificial intelligence drive the need for specialized hardware to accelerate optimization and machine learning. The search to scale compute “beyond Moore” has focused research on coupled oscillator systems. The key motivation is ultra low-power consumption by utilizing physics as a natural compute resource. This requires a new hardware architecture fundamentally different than modern computers used today. 

Our goal is to unlock new possibilities in AI by creating the first commercially viable oscillatory computing systems. We're very excited about this emerging class of technology.
