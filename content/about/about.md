# Gigabug Computer

## Revolutionizing Computing Through Physics

At Gigabug Computer, we're developing novel printed circuit boards to bring physics-based computing into the mainstream. Our goal is to unlock new possibilities in optimization and AI by creating the first commercially viable oscillatory computing systems.

### The Need for New Compute Paradigms

The rise of artificial intelligence has created an insatiable demand for specialized hardware that can solve complex optimization problems more efficiently. Current approaches are hitting physical limits, making it harder to scale performance while keeping costs manageable.

Gigabug is focused on developing hardware implementations of Ising machines - systems that leverage the natural dynamics of coupled oscillators to find optimal solutions through an annealing process. This approach has the potential to be orders of magnitude more energy-efficient than traditional computing methods for certain classes of problems.

### The Science Behind Our Technology

Ising machines are inspired by quantum mechanics and statistical physics, where the system evolves towards its lowest energy state through a process called annealing:

$$H = - \mathbf{s}^T \mathbf{J} \mathbf{s}$$

Our circuit implementations use analog dynamics to efficiently solve these optimization problems while maintaining classical compatibility. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical physics and practical computing applications.

### Tackling Real-World Challenges

While there has been significant research in this area, several barriers remain:

- Scaling systems to commercial levels
- Improving energy efficiency
- Ensuring reliability and accuracy

At Gigabug, we're addressing these challenges through innovative circuit design. Our approach combines the best of analog and digital computing to create practical solutions that maintain theoretical performance while being implementable in real-world applications.

### Join Us In Shaping The Future Of Computing

We're excited about the potential of physics-based computing to transform industries ranging from logistics optimization to machine learning. If you're passionate about cutting-edge technology and want to be part of this revolution, we'd love to hear from you.
